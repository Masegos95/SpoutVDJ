# SpoutVDJ
Spout plugins for [Virtual DJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/) developed using the VirtualDJ 8 plugin SDK and Spout SDK version 2.007.

There are two versions of each, 32bit (VDJSpoutReceiver and VDJSpoutSender) and 64 bit (VDJSpoutReceiver64 and VDJSpoutSender64) for the corresponding versions of VirtualDJ. The plugins will not work on VirtualDJ 7 or earlier.

See Releases for binaries.  

For the 64 bit plugins

VDJSpoutSender64.dll must be copied to - Documents > VirtualDJ > Plugins64 > VideoEffect

VDJSpoutReceiver64.dll must be copied to - Documents > VirtualDJ > Plugins64 > Visualisations

"SpoutPanel.exe" is used by VDJSpoutReceiver64 to show a list of Spout senders and will be detected after SpoutSettings from [Spout 2.006 Update 4](https://leadedge.github.io/spout-download.html) has been run once, or after a previous Spout installation.

Your support will help the project continue and develop.
