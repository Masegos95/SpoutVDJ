# SpoutVDJ
Spout plugins for [Virtual DJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/) developed using the VirtualDJ 8 plugin SDK and Spout SDK version 2.007.013.

There are two plugin projects, VDJSpoutReceiver64 and VDJSpoutSender64, both 64 bit only. The plugins will not work on VirtualDJ 7 or earlier.

See Releases for binaries.  

VDJSpoutSender64.dll must be copied to - Documents > VirtualDJ > Plugins64 > VideoEffect

VDJSpoutReceiver64.dll must be copied to - Documents > VirtualDJ > Plugins64 > Visualisations

"SpoutPanel.exe" is used by VDJSpoutReceiver64 to show a list of Spout senders and will be detected after SpoutSettings from the latest [Spout release](https://leadedge.github.io/spout-download.html) has been run once.
